"""
This is David's solution to the killer sudoku challenge

The set of possibilities for a square is represented as the 1 bits in an integer.
For example if a square is 7 that means the square is one of [1, 2, 3]

A possible combination of digits for a section is represented as the 1 bits in an integer.
For example a combo of 7 that means the section contains [1, 2, 3]

possible constraints to implement:
âœ“ if {5} becomes the value of a square remove 5 from all friends
x initialise squares within a section 3 long with a total of 10 to only allow numbers found in combos[3][10]
x on each change in a section
    x work out which of combos[3][10] is still possible and only allow square possibilities in that
x if 5 is only allowed in one square in a group (of size 9) set that square to 5
