Family killer sudoku competition
================================

After the success of last year's family chess completion 
Michael Howlett has challenged the family to solve killer sudoku 
problems quickly.

We will all try to solve a set of killer sudoku problems. 
The winner will be the person who solves a test selection of problems 
fastest. If we can't solve the all the test problems then the winner 
is the person who solves the greatest number of them.

Rules
=====
- Don't look at the existing literature or code for solving sudoku/killer sudoku problems. We believe it is more interesting to figure out everything from scratch.
- Don't spy on other people's techniques.
- Don't copy other people's code.
- All solutions must be written in python.
- You must write a general solver capable of solving all killer sudoku problems. 
- Don't specialise your solver for the problems provided.
- Your program should be called <your name>s_solver.py
