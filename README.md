Family killer sudoku competition
================================

After the success of last year's family chess completion 
Michael Howlett challenged the family to solve killer sudoku 
problems quickly.

We all tried to solve a set of killer sudoku problems. 
We agreed the winner would be the person who solved a test selection of problems 
fastest. If we can't solve the all the test problems then the winner 
is the person who solves the greatest number of them.

Rules
=====
- We didn't look at the existing literature or code for solving sudoku/killer sudoku problems. We believe it is more interesting to figure out everything from scratch.
- We didn't spy on each others techniques or code.
- All solutions were to be written in python.
- We agreed not to specialise our solutions to the problems provided.
- We agreed to count the winner as the person with the fastest solver at midnight on Christmas Eve.


Result
======

On Christmas Eve both Micheal and Robert both conceded victory to as I appeared to have the fastest solver for both problems available at the time.


A few weeks I increased the number of problems from 2 to 48 and reran the competition. 
It turned out that my solver had been lucky with the one hard problem available at the 
time and that Robert's solver was on average faster at the difficult problems.
