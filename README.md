Family killer sudoko competition
================================

After the success of last year's family chess completion Micheal Howlett has 
challenged the family to solve killer sudoku problems quickly.

We will all try to solve a set of killer sudoko problems. 
The winner will be the person who solves a test selection of problems fastest.
If we can't solve the all the test problems then the winner is the person who solves the most.
